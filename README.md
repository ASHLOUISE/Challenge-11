## Overview
A note taker application to write and save notes. HTML routes were created. GET/notes returns the notes.html file and GET* returns the index.html file. Api routes were also created. GET/api/notes reads the db.json file and returns all saved notes as JSON. POST/api/notes receives a new note to save the request and adds it to the db.json file. I also created a store.js which I used to import modules, file operations, store class, read()Method, write()Method, getNotes()Method, addNote()Method and removeNote()Method. 

## Usage
- To create a new note, click on the "New" button.
- Enter a title and text for your note, then click on the "Save" button.
- Your new note will be displayed in the list on the left-hand side.
- To view a note, click on its title in the list.
- To delete a note, click on the trash icon next to the note in the list.
